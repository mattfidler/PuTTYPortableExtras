#+TITLE: PuTTYPortable Extensions Needed for Emacs
#+AUTHOR: Matthew L. Fidler

To use TRAMP, Emacs may need the almost the complete putty package, or
 - pscp?
 - psftp?
 - plink
 - Pageant
 - PuTTYgen

These are included here and upxed.  I have also changed PuTTy to Putty
tray and upxed it as well.  I have made [[http://code.google.com/p/putty-portable-extras/downloads/detail?name=PuttyPortableExtrasInstaller-0.62.exe&can=2&q=][an installer]].
